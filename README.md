# ðŸ”¥PyReload

Automatically reloads your python scripts when you save them!

## ðŸ”® How To Use

Just run `python main.py <file_path>` where `<file_path>` is the path to the file you want to reload.

> You can also pass arguments to the script, as you would when running it normally: `python main.py <file_path> <arg1> <arg2> ...`.

## ðŸš§ TODO

-   [ ] Installation Script
-   [ ] Reload when one of the imported modules is changed
